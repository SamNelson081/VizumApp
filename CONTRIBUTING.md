## How to Propose a Change to Vizumap

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it is a problem. If you have found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

Guidelines for contributors:

* Create a named branch (not master) which merges cleanly with master.
* Limit the scope of the pull request to a clearly defined improvement or fix.
* Follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). Please do not restyle code unrelated to your PR.
* Use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.
* Use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes you made followed by your
GitHub username and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
* After you merge a pull request, delete the associated branch if you can. You will see an option for this on the GitHub pull request page.

Every pull request will be reviewed by @lydialucchesi or @pkuhnert. They will either merge it or provide feedback on issues to be addressed. They may add additional commits to the pull request. @lydialucchesi and @pkuhnert can make minor edits to a pull request (e.g., fixing typos) before merging it.
